# Shell 

> A computer will do what you tell it to do, but that may be much different from what you had in mind.

A shell is a program that acts as an interface between a user and the kernel. it allows the userto give command to the kernel and receives responses from it.Through a shell, we can execute programs and utilities on the kernel. Hence, at its core, a shell is a program used to execute other programs on our system.
